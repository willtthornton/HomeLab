# Willâ€™s Home Lab (Public)

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and evolution of my home IT lab. The primary goal is to practice and demonstrate fundamental IT skills, including network design, system administration, and professional documentation.

The first major project, **Home Network Segmentation with VLANs**, is now complete. This project involved designing and implementing a secure, segmented home network using VLANs to isolate trusted devices, IoT hardware, gaming consoles, and a dedicated lab environment. The project successfully achieved a high-performance network, overcoming initial hardware instabilities through systematic troubleshooting. The final architecture provides complete traffic isolation and robust administrative access.

> [!NOTE]
> For privacy and security, specific device models, IP addresses, and network names have been generalized or replaced with common examples. The focus is on demonstrating the network design, configuration methodology, and technical skills involved.
